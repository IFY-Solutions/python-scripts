-   Baby name webpages have been downloaded to the local filesystem with each
    year contained in a file name birth<year>.html.

1.  Write a python script which scrapes all html files in the directory and
    reports the top 5 names for each year for both boys and girls.

2.  Write a python script which details the rankings over the available years
    for the baby names "Ryan", "Ben", and "Eugene".
